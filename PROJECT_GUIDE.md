# Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Platform (Backend First)

## Overview
A multi-vendor e-commerce platform where:
- Vendors can list products, manage inventory, and track sales.
- Customers can browse products, add to cart, and checkout using Stripe.
- Admins can oversee vendors, customers, orders, and real-time analytics.

The system follows a **microservice architecture** with strong focus on **scalability, security, and real-time analytics**.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: NestJS (TypeScript, Microservices)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (OLTP), ClickHouse (Analytics)
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Event Streaming**: Kafka
- **Search**: Elasticsearch
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Keycloak (OIDC + RBAC)
- **Payments**: Stripe Connect (marketplace model)
- **Storage**: AWS S3 + CloudFront
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes + Helm + ArgoCD

- Integrates with Keycloak.
- Role management: `admin`, `vendor`, `customer`.
- JWT/OIDC-based session handling.

### 2. User Service
- User profile CRUD.
- Preferences & saved addresses.
- Linked to orders & carts.

### 3. Vendor Service
- Vendor onboarding & KYC approval by admin.
- Vendor dashboard for sales & inventory.
- Vendor payout details (Stripe account connection).

### 4. Product Service
- CRUD for products & categories.
- Inventory sync.
- Media storage on S3.
- Search indexing in Elasticsearch.

### 5. Order Service
- Shopping cart handling.
- Checkout flow.
- Order lifecycle: `pending → paid → shipped → delivered → refunded`.
- List orders by user or vendor.

### 6. Payment Service
- Stripe Connect integration.
- Payment intents & webhooks.
- Vendor payouts with platform fees.
- Refunds & dispute handling.

### 7. Analytics Service
- Collects real-time events via Kafka.
- Stores aggregate data in ClickHouse.
- Provides dashboards (sales, active users, top products).
- Vendor-level and admin-level analytics.

### 8. Notification Service
- Sends transactional emails & push notifications.
- Integrates with Kafka events.
- Templates for order status, vendor approvals, etc.

### 9. Search Service
- Product search powered by Elasticsearch.
- Supports filters (category, price, rating).
- Autocomplete & suggestions.

### 10. Admin Service
- Vendor approval/rejection.
- Reports & large dataset exports (CSV/Excel).
- Moderation of vendors, products, reviews.

## Event Flows (Kafka Topics)

- `order.placed` → triggers inventory update, payment intent, analytics.
- `order.paid` → updates vendor sales & analytics.
- `order.shipped` → notifies customer.
- `payment.success` → updates order status, vendor payout queue.
- `payment.failed` → notifies customer, retries or cancels.
- `payment.refund` → updates order & analytics.

---

## Deployment Strategy

- Each service containerized (Docker).
- Managed via Kubernetes with separate namespaces per service.
- Helm charts for:
  - PostgreSQL
  - ClickHouse
  - Redis
  - Kafka
  - Elasticsearch
  - Keycloak
- GitOps pipeline with ArgoCD.
- Autoscaling with HPA.
- Service mesh for inter-service communication.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of vendors and millions of products.
- **Security**:
  - PCI DSS compliance for payments.
  - RBAC via Keycloak.
  - Rate limiting & input validation.
- **Performance**:
  - Redis caching for hot queries.
  - Kafka for event-driven reliability.
- **Observability**:
  - Metrics in Prometheus.
  - Dashboards in Grafana.
  - Centralized logging in Loki.
- **High Availability**:
  - Multi-replica deployments.
  - DB backups & failover.
